<h3>Bank Customer Churn Analysis</h3>

```python

"Customer churn" is when customers cease their relationship with a company or business, typically by
discontinuing their use of its products or services. It is a significant concern for businesses
across various industries, including telecommunications, software, e-commerce, and subscription-based
services.

Customer churn is a crucial metric impacting a company’s profitability and growth. Losing existing
customers leads to revenue decline and incurs costs associated with acquiring new customers to
replace the lost ones. High customer churn can also damage a company’s reputation and hinder its
long-term sustainability.
